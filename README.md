# PocketPages 📝

PocketPages is a modern, offline-first, and feature-rich note-taking application for Android, inspired by the versatility of Notion. It provides a clean, block-based editor designed for everything from quick notes and to-do lists to structured databases and long-form writing, all while ensuring your data is always available, even without an internet connection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

PocketPages is built using a modern, scalable architecture that separates concerns and promotes best practices.

- **Language**: **Kotlin** (100% Kotlin codebase)
- **Architecture**: **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** - A clean and testable architecture pattern
  - **View**: Activities and XML Layouts for the UI
  - **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and state, surviving configuration changes
  - **Model**: The Repository pattern, which acts as the single source of truth for all app data
- **Asynchronous Programming**: **Kotlin Coroutines** for managing background threads and asynchronous operations like database access
- **Database**: **Room Persistence Library** - A powerful SQLite object mapping library for robust local data storage and caching
- **UI**: 
  - Android XML Layouts with Material Design 3 components
  - RecyclerView for displaying dynamic lists of pages and blocks efficiently
- **Dependency Management**: **Gradle** with Kotlin DSL (.kts)

## 📱 Usage

1. **Creating Pages**: Tap the "+" button to create a new page
2. **Adding Content**: Use the block-based editor to add different types of content
3. **Organizing**: Pages are automatically saved and can be organized in your preferred structure
4. **Offline Access**: All your data is stored locally and accessible without an internet connection

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
